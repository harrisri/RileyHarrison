# Beer & Brewery RESTful API
This API allows access to a database that holds information on breweries and beers.  Beers are sold at breweries and users own breweries.  Beer can only be added/removed from breweries if the user owns the brewery.  The same goes for edit and delete functionality of breweries.  Anyone can view information on beer or breweries.
